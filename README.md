Purpose
-------

Python nsmclient is a convenience wrapper around liblo and the NSM-protocol to
implement Non Session support easily in your own Python programs. You don't
need any OSC knowledge to use this package.


Instructions
------------

Copy `nsmclient.py` into your source directory or use

    python3 setup.py install

to install `nsmclient.py` system-wide. Both variants are equally good. Just
copying it to your own source tree does not require your users to install
nsmclient themselves. Since this is a really small lib I recommend this
approach.

In your own program:

    import nsmclient

Then call `nsmclient.init()` with the correct parameters.

Please see `example.py`, a well documented, minimal and working example.
Only 30 lines of code.

The important part is that your application follows the NSM rules (see
example.py documentation and NSM website http://non.tuxfamily.org/nsm/API.html)


Dependencies
------------

* [Non Session Manager](http://non.tuxfamily.org/nsm/)
* [liblo](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/) (tested with version 0.26)
* [pyliblo](http://das.nasophon.de/pyliblo/) - Python 3 bindings for liblo.
  (tested with version 0.9.1)
